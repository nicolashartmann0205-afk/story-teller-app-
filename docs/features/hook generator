sql-- Track hook generation requests for analytics and rate limiting
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS hook_generations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  story_id UUID REFERENCES stories(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  hook_types TEXT[], -- Array of requested types
  context JSONB, -- Story context sent to AI
  generated_count INTEGER, -- How many hooks generated
  selected_hook_id TEXT, -- Which hook was chosen
  generation_time_ms INTEGER, -- Performance tracking
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Index for user query
CREATE INDEX idx_hook_gen_user ON hook_generations(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_hook_gen_story ON hook_generations(story_id);
```
