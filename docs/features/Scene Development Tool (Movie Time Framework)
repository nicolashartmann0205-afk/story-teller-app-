## 10. Risks & Mitigations

### 10.1 Technical Risks

**Risk: AI Generation Latency**
- **Impact:** User frustration if scene generation takes >5 seconds
- **Probability:** Medium (depends on API load)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Implement request timeout at 10 seconds
  - Show estimated time and progress indicator
  - Cache common generation patterns
  - Allow user to continue editing other scenes while waiting
  - Provide "Cancel" option for long requests
  - Use streaming responses if available from Claude API

**Risk: Database Query Performance**
- **Impact:** Slow load times with 20+ scenes
- **Probability:** Low (with proper indexing)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Index story_id and position fields
  - Lazy load scene content (load list first, content on demand)
  - Implement pagination for 50+ scenes
  - Use Supabase real-time efficiently
  - Monitor query performance with logging

**Risk: Auto-save Conflicts**
- **Impact:** Data loss or overwrites in multi-device scenarios
- **Probability:** Low (single user, but possible)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Implement optimistic locking with version numbers
  - Show conflict resolution UI if detected
  - Use Supabase real-time to detect concurrent edits
  - "Last write wins" with user notification
  - Offer to save conflicting version separately

### 10.2 User Experience Risks

**Risk: Framework Too Complex**
- **Impact:** Users abandon scene tool due to perceived difficulty
- **Probability:** Medium (three sections may feel overwhelming)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Progressive disclosure: start with ACTION only, unlock others
  - Clear "Movie Time Explained" tutorial on first use
  - Allow skipping optional fields
  - Templates reduce cognitive load
  - Quick Mode simplifies to essential fields only
  - Show completion percentage to encourage progress

**Risk: AI Generates Poor Quality Scenes**
- **Impact:** Loss of trust in AI features, manual writing only
- **Probability:** Medium (depends on prompt quality and user input)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Extensive prompt engineering and testing
  - Clear expectation setting: "AI provides drafts, you refine"
  - Easy regeneration with different parameters
  - "Edit AI Draft" as primary CTA, not "Accept"
  - Collect feedback on AI quality
  - A/B test different generation prompts
  - Show Don't Tell Coach helps improve even AI drafts

**Risk: Show Don't Tell Coach Feels Pedantic**
- **Impact:** Users ignore coach, feature unused
- **Probability:** Medium (depends on feedback tone)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Friendly, encouraging tone in feedback
  - Focus on top 3 improvements, not exhaustive list
  - Make suggestions optional, not mandatory
  - Show score improvement over time (gamification)
  - Allow dismissing coach entirely if desired
  - Test feedback language with beta users

### 10.3 Business Risks

**Risk: Low Feature Adoption**
- **Impact:** Development effort doesn't translate to usage
- **Probability:** Low-Medium (if not well-integrated)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Make scene development optional but recommended
  - Integrate tightly with story structure (auto-suggest scenes)
  - Show value early: template library immediately useful
  - Onboarding specifically highlights this feature
  - Success stories from beta users
  - Track drop-off points and optimize

**Risk: Over-reliance on AI**
- **Impact:** Users expect AI to write entire story, disappointed
- **Probability:** Medium (common misconception)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Clear messaging: AI assists, doesn't replace creativity
  - Limit AI generation to scene-level, not full story
  - Require user input before generation
  - Educational content about writing craft
  - Show Don't Tell Coach teaches, doesn't just fix
  - Celebrate user edits and customization

**Risk: Feature Scope Creep**
- **Impact:** Development timeline extends, delays MVP
- **Probability:** High (many possible enhancements)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Strict adherence to FReD scope for v1.0
  - Park "nice to have" features for v2.0
  - Focus on core Movie Time framework first
  - Templates can start with 5, expand to 10 later
  - Show Don't Tell Coach can be basic initially
  - Ruthlessly prioritize must-haves

### 10.4 Content Risks

**Risk: Inappropriate AI-Generated Content**
- **Impact:** Offensive or harmful scene content generated
- **Probability:** Low (Claude API has safety measures)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Content filtering on AI outputs
  - User reporting mechanism
  - Clear content policy
  - Manual review of flagged content
  - Age-appropriate filtering based on story type
  - Opt-out of AI features available

**Risk: Copyright/Plagiarism in AI Output**
- **Impact:** AI inadvertently reproduces copyrighted material
- **Probability:** Very Low (Claude designed to avoid this)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Include disclaimer about AI-generated content
  - Encourage users to review and edit all AI outputs
  - Plagiarism checker integration (future)
  - Clear terms of service about content ownership
  - User owns all final output

  - Option C: Hard limit at 100 scenes (performance concern)
  - **Recommendation:** Soft limit at 50 with warning

**Template Customization:**
- ❓ Should users be able to create/save their own templates?
  - v1.0: No (use pre-built 10 only)
  - v2.0: Yes (custom template library)
  - **Recommendation:** v2.0 feature, parking for now

**AI Draft Versioning:**
- ❓ How many AI draft versions to keep?
  - Option A: Last 3 versions
  - Option B: Last 5 versions
  - Option C: All versions (storage concern)

**Export Format:**
- ❓ How should scenes appear in exported story?
  - Option A: Continuous prose (scenes flow together)
  - Option B: Chapter breaks at scene boundaries
  - Option C: User choice per export
  - **Recommendation:** User choice, default to continuous

**Moral Conflict Integration:**

- ❓ Should multiple users be able to edit same scene simultaneously?
  - v1.0: No (single user app)
  - Future: Yes (collaborative writing feature)
  - **Recommendation:** Park for future, focus single user

**Offline Capability:**
- ❓ How much functionality should work offline?
  - Scene editing: Yes
  - Auto-save queue: Yes
  - AI generation: No (requires API)
  - Scene list: Yes (cached)
  - **Recommendation:** Core editing offline, AI features online only

**Mobile Experience:**
- ❓ Should mobile have full feature parity or simplified version?
  - Option A: Full parity (responsive design)
  - Option B: Simplified (hide advanced features)
  - Option C: View-only (edit on desktop)
  - **Recommendation:** Option B - simplified but functional

### 13.2 AI Prompt Templates

**Scene Generation Prompt Structure:**
```
You are a creative writing assistant helping to develop a scene for a story.

STORY CONTEXT:
- Story Type: {storyType}
- Mode: {mode}
- Overall Stakes: {overallStakes}
- Theme: {theme}

SCENE FRAMEWORK (Movie Time):

ACTION:
- Where: {where}
- What's happening: {what}
- What happens next: {next}

EMOTION:
- Characters involved: {characters}
- Stakes: {stakes}
- Tone: {emotionalTone}

- Structure beat: {structureBeat}
- Previous scene summary: {previousScene}

Generate a vivid, engaging scene (300-500 words) that:
1. Shows concrete visual action (don't just tell)
2. Conveys emotion through physical details and dialogue
3. Advances the story meaningfully
4. Uses sensory details appropriate to the location
5. Maintains the specified emotional tone
6. Leads to the stated change/meaning

Write in {pov} perspective, in a {style} style suitable for a {storyType}.
```

**Show Don't Tell Analysis Prompt:**
```
You are a writing coach analyzing a scene for "show don't tell" effectiveness.

SCENE TEXT:
{sceneContent}

Analyze this scene and provide:

1. OVERALL SCORE (1-10):
- How well does this scene SHOW rather than TELL?
- Consider visual description, sensory details, character actions

2. TELLING PHRASES (identify 3-5):
For each phrase that "tells" rather than "shows":
- Quote the original phrase
- Suggest a "showing" alternative
- Explain why in one sentence

3. IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES:
- Sensory details that could be added
- Dialogue opportunities
- Physical action suggestions

4. TOP PRIORITY:
What single change would most improve this scene?

Format response as JSON for easy parsing.
```

**Sensory Detail Enhancement Prompt:**
```
Given this scene location and action:

LOCATION: {where}
ACTION: {what}

Suggest 5 sensory details that would make this scene more vivid:
- 2 visual details (what can be seen)
- 1 auditory detail (what can be heard)
- 1 tactile detail (texture, temperature, physical sensation)
- 1 smell or taste detail (if appropriate)

Make suggestions brief (10-15 words each) and specific to this scene.
Return as array of strings.
```
