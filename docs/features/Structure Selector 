7. AI Integration Specifications
7.1 AI Structure Recommendation
System Prompt:
javascriptconst structureRecommendationPrompt = `You are an expert in narrative structures and the Storyteller Tactics framework. Your task is to recommend the most appropriate story structure based on the user's context.

Consider:
- Story type and typical structures that work well for it
- Time constraints (quick vs. extended development)
- Audience expectations
- Character archetype and natural story arcs
- Complexity tolerance

Available structures:
${structures.map(s => `${s.name}: ${s.shortDesc} - Best for: ${s.bestFor.join(', ')}`).join('\n')}

Respond with JSON:
{
  "primary": {
    "structureId": "id",
    "confidence": "high" | "medium" | "low",
    "reasoning": "2-3 sentence explanation"
  },
  "alternatives": [
    {
      "structureId": "id",
      "reason": "Why this could also work"

API Call:
javascriptconst recommendStructure = async (storyContext, availableStructures) => {

Which structure would work best?`;

    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({

  const cleaned = textContent.replace(/```json\n?|```\n?/g, '').trim();

7.2 AI Beat Draft Generation (Deep Guidance)

Emotion: ${beat.emotion}

Story Context:
- Type: ${storyContext.storyType.type.name}
- Character: ${storyContext.character.primary?.name}
- Audience: ${storyContext.audience.primary}

Previous Beats (for continuity):
${previousBeats.map(b => `${b.beatName}: ${b.userContent}`).join('\n')}

Guiding Questions for this beat:
${beat.guidance.questions.join('\n')}

Write a 2-4 sentence draft for this beat that:
1. Answers the guiding questions
2. Maintains continuity with previous beats
3. Uses concrete, vivid language
4. Fits the emotional tone: ${beat.emotion}
5. Is appropriate for the story type and audience

Return only the draft text, no explanation.`;

      model: 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514',
      max_tokens: 400,
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }]

};
7.3 AI Outline Generation (Light Guidance)
javascriptconst generateStructureOutline = async (structure, storyContext) => {
  const prompt = `Generate a story outline using the ${structure.name} structure.

Story Context:
- Type: ${storyContext.storyType.type.name}
- Character: ${storyContext.character.primary?.name}
- Audience: ${storyContext.audience.primary}
- Purpose: ${storyContext.purpose}
- Conflict: ${storyContext.conflict?.central}

Structure: ${structure.name}
Key Beats: ${structure.beats.map(b => b.name).join(', ')}

Create a custom outline with ${structure.beats.length} beats. For each beat:
1. Use the beat name from the structure
2. Write a 1-2 sentence suggestion specific to their story
3. Indicate approximate duration as percentage

Return JSON array:
[
  {
    "beatName": "Beat name",
    "suggestion": "Specific suggestion for their story",
    "duration": "20%"
  }
]`;

  const response = await fetch('https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514',
      max_tokens: 2000,
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }]
    })
  });

  const data = await response.json();
  const textContent = data.content.find(c => c.type === 'text')?.text || '[]';
  const cleaned = textContent.replace(/```json\n?|```\n?/g, '').trim();
  return JSON.parse(cleaned);
};

## 11. Open Questions & Risks

### 11.1 Open Questions

1. **Should we allow custom structure creation?**
   - Pro: Ultimate flexibility for advanced users
   - Con: Loses framework benefits, hard to guide
   - **Recommendation**: No for MVP, consider for Phase 2

2. **Should beats be reorderable?**
   - Some structures are sequential, others flexible
   - **Recommendation**: Lock order for sequential structures, allow flexibility for others

3. **How to handle very long stories?**
   - 12-beat Hero's Journey for a novel = lots of content
   - **Recommendation**: Allow beat expansion (sub-beats) in Phase 2

4. **Should we show structure recommendations from other users?**
   - "85% of business pitches use Three-Act Structure"
   - **Recommendation**: Test in Phase 2 after gathering data

5. **Multi-structure stories?**
   - Some stories use multiple structures for different parts
   - **Recommendation**: MVP = single structure, Phase 2 = nested structures

### 11.2 Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Users overwhelmed by structure complexity | High | Medium | Clear guidance levels, AI recommendations, examples |
| Structure feels too restrictive | Medium | Medium | Emphasize as guide not formula, allow skipping beats |
| Deep Guidance too time-consuming | Medium | Medium | Auto-save, clear progress indicators, ability to pause |
| AI beat drafts are generic | High | Low | Context-aware prompts, user editing always available |
| Users don't complete all beats | Medium | High | Show progress, celebrate milestones, allow partial completion |
| Structure-story mismatch | High | Low | AI recommendations, detailed "best for" guidance |

### 11.3 Technical Risks

**Auto-Save Conflicts**:
- Risk: User edits on multiple devices, conflicting saves
- Mitigation: Last-write-wins with conflict detection, show warning

**AI Cost for Beat Drafts**:
- Risk: 12 beats × many users = high API costs
- Mitigation: Optional feature, caching common patterns, smart prompting

**Performance with Large Beat Content**:
- Risk: Rich text editor slows with long beats
- Mitigation: Text area instead of rich editor, pagination for very long content

12.3 State Management Pattern
javascript// In StoryContext
const [storyData, setStoryData] = useState({
  // ... other story data
  structure: {
    guidanceLevel: null,
    selected: null,
    beats: [],
    aiOutline: null,
    selectedAt: null,
    beatsCompleted: 0,
    progressPercentage: 0
  }
});

// Helper functions
const selectStructure = (structure, guidanceLevel) => {
  setStoryData(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    structure: {
      ...prev.structure,
      selected: structure,
      guidanceLevel,
      selectedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
      totalBeats: structure.beats?.length || 0
    }
  }));
};

const updateBeat = (beatNumber, content) => {
  setStoryData(prev => {
    const updatedBeats = [...prev.structure.beats];
    const beatIndex = updatedBeats.findIndex(b => b.beatNumber === beatNumber);
    
    if (beatIndex >= 0) {
      updatedBeats[beatIndex] = {
        ...updatedBeats[beatIndex],
        userContent: content,
        isEdited: true,
        wordCount: content.split(/\s+/).length
      };
    } else {
      updatedBeats.push({
        beatNumber,
        beatName: prev.structure.selected.beats[beatNumber - 1].name,
        userContent: content,
        isEdited: true,
        completedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
        wordCount: content.split(/\s+/).length
      });
    }
    
    const completed = updatedBeats.filter(b => b.userContent?.length > 0).length;
    
    return {
      ...prev,
      structure: {
        ...prev.structure,
        beats: updatedBeats,
        beatsCompleted: completed,
        progressPercentage: Math.round((completed / prev.structure.totalBeats) * 100)
      }
    };
  });
};

const generateAIOutline = async (structure) => {
  const outline = await generateStructureOutline(structure, storyData);
  setStoryData(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    structure: {
      ...prev.structure,
      aiOutline: {
        generated: true,
        beats: outline,
        generatedAt: new Date().toISOString()
      }
    }
  }));
};
12.4 Auto-Save Implementation
javascript// useAutoSave hook
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { debounce } from 'lodash';

const useAutoSave = (data, saveFunction, delay = 30000) => {
  const [isSaving, setIsSaving] = useState(false);
  const [lastSaved, setLastSaved] = useState(null);
  
  const debouncedSave = useRef(
    debounce(async (dataToSave) => {
      setIsSaving(true);
      try {
        await saveFunction(dataToSave);
        setLastSaved(new Date());
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Auto-save failed:', error);
      } finally {
        setIsSaving(false);
      }
    }, delay)
  ).current;

  useEffect(() => {
    if (data) {
      debouncedSave(data);
    }
  }, [data, debouncedSave]);

  return { isSaving, lastSaved };
};

// Usage in BeatEditor
const { isSaving, lastSaved } = useAutoSave(
  storyData.structure,
  saveStoryToDatabase,
  30000 // 30 seconds
);
