4.7 AI Moral Analysis
Feature: "🤖 Analyze Moral Depth"
AI Reviews Story Elements:

Character archetypes
Conflict description
Stakes
Story type
Existing scenes (if any)

AI Provides:
1. Implicit Moral Conflicts:
"Your story has an implicit Care vs. Harm conflict:
- Sarah (Caregiver) wants to protect vulnerable users
- The company prioritizes profit over user wellbeing
- Consider making this moral dimension explicit"
2. Moral Complexity Suggestions:
"Add depth by making the antagonist believe they're right:
- What if Marcus thinks efficiency helps MORE people?
- 'We can't save everyone' vs. 'We must try anyway'
- This creates a Two Rights conflict"
3. Character Moral Enhancement:
"Your hero's archetype (Rebel) naturally aligns with
Liberty vs. Oppression. Consider:
- What freedom is being restricted?
- Who benefits from the constraint?
- Is rebellion always justified?"
4. Moral Stakes Integration:
"Your stakes are practical (money, time, success).
Add a moral dimension:
- It's not just about winning, but winning the right way
- What moral line might be tempted to cross?
- What happens if they compromise their values?"
5. Decision Point Recommendations:
"Key scenes for moral dilemmas:
- Scene 3: Force character to choose between Loyalty and Fairness
- Scene 7: Test their commitment to Care when it's costly
- Scene 10: Final choice reveals true moral position"

## 10. Risks & Mitigations

### 10.1 Conceptual Risks

**Risk: Framework Too Academic**
- **Impact:** Users intimidated by moral foundations theory
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use simple, relatable language
  - Lead with examples, not theory
  - Never mention "Jonathan Haidt" or academic concepts
  - Focus on story applications
  - Optional "Learn More" for interested users
  - Tutorial uses familiar story examples

**Risk: Overwhelming Complexity**
- **Impact:** Users confused by six conflicts plus complexity levels
- **Probability:** Medium-High
- **Mitigation:**
  - Progressive disclosure (one step at a time)
  - Clear "Skip This" option prominent
  - Quick Mode makes it optional
  - AI can pre-select most relevant
  - Visual hierarchy emphasizes simple path
  - Examples show it's not as hard as it looks

**Risk: Moral Relativism Concerns**
- **Impact:** Users uncomfortable with presenting "bad" side as justified
- **Probability:** Low-Medium
- **Mitigation:**
  - Frame as "understanding motivations" not endorsing
  - Emphasize this creates realistic, nuanced stories
  - Clear that complexity ≠ moral equivalence
  - Simple option always available for clear good/evil
  - Examples show how this enhances storytelling

### 10.2 User Experience Risks

**Risk: Unclear Value Proposition**
- **Impact:** Users don't understand why moral framework helps
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:**
  - Lead with benefit: "Add depth and meaning"
  - Show before/after examples
  - "Stories with moral depth engage readers more deeply"
  - Optional feature (can skip)
  - Success stories from beta users
  - Quick wins (AI shows implicit conflict already there)

**Risk: Forced Moral Framework**
- **Impact:** Users feel pressured to add moral dimension
- **Probability:** Low
- **Mitigation:**
  - Always optional (never required)
  - "Skip" button prominent
  - "Not all stories need explicit moral framework"
  - Can add later if desired
  - Quick Mode defaults to skip
  - No penalty for skipping

**Risk: Cultural/Religious Sensitivity**
- **Impact:** Framework offends due to moral assumptions
- **Probability:** Low
- **Mitigation:**
  - Present as one lens, not THE truth
  - Acknowledge different cultures emphasize different values
  - User defines what each value means in their context
  - No judgments about "right" moral positions
  - Examples from diverse cultures
  - Beta test with diverse users

### 10.3 Technical Risks

**Risk: Complex Data Structure**
- **Impact:** JSONB becomes unwieldy, hard to query
- **Probability:** Low
- **Mitigation:**
  - Well-designed schema from start
  - Indexing on conflict IDs
  - Validation before save
  - Flattened views for common queries
  - Migration plan if restructure needed

**Risk: AI Suggestion Quality**
- **Impact:** AI generates irrelevant or poor moral suggestions
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:**
  - Extensive prompt engineering
  - Use story context effectively
  - Test with diverse story types
  - Allow regeneration
  - Make all suggestions optional
  - User feedback loop for improvement

### 10.4 Integration Risks

**Risk: Archetype-Moral Misalignment**
- **Impact:** Suggested alignments don't make sense
- **Probability:** Low
- **Mitigation:**
  - Careful mapping of archetypes to conflicts
  - Multiple conflicts can fit each archetype
  - Always user-editable
  - Explain reasoning for suggestions
  - Test all 12 archetypes thoroughly

**Risk: Scene Integration Confusion**
- **Impact:** Users don't know when to use moral stakes
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:**
  - Clear guidance in scene editor
  - Optional field (not required)
  - Examples of moral stakes in scenes
  - AI can suggest when relevant

### 13.2 AI Prompt Templates

**Implicit Conflict Detection:**
```
Analyze this story for implicit moral conflicts:

STORY CONTEXT:
- Type: {storyType}
- Character: {characterDescription}
- Archetype: {archetype}
- Conflict: {conflictDescription}
- Stakes: {stakes}

Based on this, identify:
1. Most likely moral conflict (from: care_harm, fairness_cheating, 
   liberty_oppression, authority_subversion, loyalty_betrayal, 
   purity_degradation)
2. Evidence for this conflict in the story elements
3. How it's currently implicit
4. Suggestion for making it explicit

Be specific and concise. Format as JSON.
```

**Complexity Enhancement:**
```
This story has a simple good vs. evil moral setup:
- Hero represents: {heroPosition}
- Villain represents: {villainPosition}

Suggest how to add moral complexity:
1. Two Rights approach: What valid moral position could the 
   antagonist hold?
2. Lesser Evil approach: What if both sides cause harm?
3. Specific example dialogue showing the complexity
4. Why this makes the story more engaging

Keep suggestions constructive and story-focused.
```

**Character Moral Profile:**
```
Generate moral profile for this character:

CHARACTER:
- Name: {name}
- Archetype: {archetype}
- Role: {role}

MORAL CONFLICT: {conflictName}

Provide:
1. Starting position (1-10, 1=good side, 10=bad side)
2. Three core values from: protection, justice, freedom, 
   loyalty, order, purity
3. One moral line they won't cross (50 chars)
4. One moral blind spot (50 chars)
5. Likely ending position and why

Format as JSON.
```
