Understanding The Ruler's Dark Sides
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Every archetype has shadow aspects - what happens when there's
too much or too little of the archetype's qualities.

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⚠️ TOO MUCH RULER → THE TYRANT                              │
│                                                             │
│ When the Ruler's need for order becomes extreme:           │
│ • Dogmatic and inflexible                                   │
│ • Authoritarian and controlling                             │
│ • Dismissive of others' input                               │
│ • "My way or the highway"                                   │
│                                                             │
│ Use this when: Your character's strength becomes their      │
│ downfall, or they need to learn balance                     │
│                                                             │
│ ☐ My character struggles with being too much Ruler          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⚠️ TOO LITTLE RULER → THE ABDICATOR                         │
│                                                             │
│ When the Ruler abandons their leadership:                  │
│ • Weak and passive                                          │
│ • Unable to make decisions                                  │
│ • Lacks authority                                           │
│ • Surrenders responsibility                                 │
│                                                             │
│ Use this when: Your character has lost their way, or needs  │
│ to reclaim their power                                      │
│                                                             │
│ ☐ My character starts as/becomes the Abdicator              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

💡 TIP: The best character arcs often involve moving from one
dark side through the balanced archetype to avoid the other.

Example: The Abdicator → The Ruler → Avoiding The Tyrant

    "icon": "👑",
    "values": ["order", "security", "mastery"],
    "darkSides": {
      "tooMuch": {"name": "The Tyrant", "enabled": false},
      "tooLittle": {"name": "The Abdicator", "enabled": true}
    }
  },
  "secondary": {
    "id": "sage",
    "name": "The Sage",
    "icon": "🦉"
  },
  "combined": {
    "name": "The Judge",

    "primaryInfluence": 60,
    "secondaryInfluence": 40
  },
  "journey": {
    "startArchetype": {"id": "ruler", "state": "tooLittle"},
    "transformation": {
      "catalyst": "Forced to lead...",
      "keyMoments": [...]
    },
    "endArchetype": {"id": "ruler", "state": "balanced"}
  },
  "selectionMethod": "grid",
  "selectedAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "isSimplified": false
}

-- Example stored value (Quick Mode):
{
  "primary": {
    "id": "warrior",
    "name": "The Warrior",
    "icon": "⚔️"
  },
  "selectionMethod": "ai-suggested",
  "selectedAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "isSimplified": true
}
5.2 Archetype Analytics Tracking
sql-- Track archetype selection patterns
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS archetype_analytics (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  story_id UUID REFERENCES stories(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  primary_archetype TEXT NOT NULL,
  secondary_archetype TEXT,
  story_type TEXT,
  selection_method TEXT CHECK (selection_method IN ('grid', 'ai-suggested', 'deep-builder')),
  has_journey BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  has_dark_sides BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes for analysis queries
CREATE INDEX idx_archetype_primary ON archetype_analytics(primary_archetype);
CREATE INDEX idx_archetype_story_type ON archetype_analytics(story_type);
CREATE INDEX idx_archetype_method ON archetype_analytics(selection_method);
5.3 Archetype Combinations Matrix (Static Data)
Store in /src/data/archetypeCombinations.js:
javascriptexport const archetypeCombinations = {
  ruler: {
    sage: { 
      name: 'The Judge', 
      description: 'Wise authority figure who leads through knowledge and fair judgment',
      bestFor: 'Legal stories, fair leaders, wisdom-based authority',
      examples: ['Judge Judy', 'Atticus Finch', 'Mufasa']
    },
    warrior: { 
      name: 'The Strategist',
      description: 'Tactical leader who wins through discipline and planning',
      bestFor: 'Military leaders, business competitors, strategic thinkers',
      examples: ['Napoleon', 'Patton', 'Coach from sports movies']
    },
    // ... all 11 other combinations for ruler
  },
  // ... combinations for all 12 archetypes
};
```

javascriptconst archetypeSuggestionPrompt = `You are an expert in Jungian archetypes and the Storyteller Tactics framework. Your task is to recommend the most appropriate primary archetype for a character based on their story context.

Consider:
- Story type and its typical character needs
- Target audience and what resonates with them
- Story conflict and the character traits needed to drive it
- Emotional goals and how archetypes embody different emotions

The 12 archetypes are:
1. The Ruler - Establish order, take the lead
2. The Caregiver - Protect and nourish
3. The Innocent - Pure and simple, fresh eyes
4. The Jester - Play the game, have fun
5. The Companion - Belong and connect
6. The Lover - Find intimacy, follow your heart
7. The Rebel - Break the rules, challenge authority
8. The Explorer - Discover the unknown, seek freedom
9. The Warrior - Show courage, overcome obstacles
10. The Artist - Express and create
11. The Magician - Change and possibility, transformation
12. The Sage - Truth and wisdom

Respond with a JSON object:

  const suggestion = JSON.parse(textContent.replace(/```json\n?|```\n?/g, '').trim());
  
  return suggestion;
};
7.2 Deep Builder Questionnaire Logic
Question Flow (8-10 questions, adaptive):
javascriptconst deepBuilderQuestions = [
  {
    id: 'q1_motivation',
    question: 'What drives your character most?',
    options: [

      { text: 'Personal freedom and discovery', scores: { explorer: 3, rebel: 2 } },
      { text: 'Connection and belonging', scores: { companion: 3, lover: 1 } },
      { text: 'Creative expression', scores: { artist: 3, magician: 1 } }
    ]
  },
  {
    id: 'q2_conflict_response',
    question: 'When facing obstacles, your character:',
    options: [

      { text: 'Rallies others to help', scores: { companion: 2, ruler: 2 } },
      { text: 'Looks for ways around the problem', scores: { explorer: 2, jester: 1 } }
    ]
  },
  {
    id: 'q3_relationships',
    question: 'In relationships, your character is:',
    options: [

  },
  // ... 5-7 more adaptive questions
];

const calculateArchetypeScores = (answers) => {
  const scores = {};
  
  answers.forEach(answer => {
    Object.entries(answer.scores).forEach(([archetype, points]) => {
      scores[archetype] = (scores[archetype] || 0) + points;
    });
  });
  
  // Sort by score
  const sorted = Object.entries(scores)
    .sort(([,a], [,b]) => b - a)
    .map(([archetype, score]) => ({ archetype, score }));
  
  return {
    primary: sorted[0],
    alternatives: sorted.slice(1, 4) // Top 3 alternatives
  };
};
7.3 Journey Scene Suggestions
javascriptconst generateJourneyScenes = async (characterJourney) => {
  const prompt = `Based on this character transformation journey, suggest 3-5 key scenes that would powerfully show this arc:

Start: ${characterJourney.startArchetype.id} (${characterJourney.startArchetype.state})
End: ${characterJourney.endArchetype.id} (${characterJourney.endArchetype.state})
Catalyst: ${characterJourney.transformation.catalyst}

For each scene, provide:
1. Scene name/title
2. What happens (1-2 sentences)
3. How it shows character change
4. Which archetype aspects are visible

Return as JSON array.`;

  // API call similar to previous examples
  // Returns scene suggestions for user's story map
};

## 10. User Acceptance Criteria

### 10.1 Acceptance Tests

**Test 1: Quick Mode - AI Suggestion Path**
- ✅ User in Quick Mode enters archetype builder
- ✅ AI suggestion automatically appears
- ✅ Shows 1 primary recommendation with confidence level
- ✅ Shows 2-3 alternative options
- ✅ User can accept AI suggestion
- ✅ User can browse grid instead
- ✅ Selection saves to state and database
- ✅ User advances to next step

**Test 2: Comprehensive Mode - Grid Browsing**

- ✅ Cards show icon, name, tagline clearly
- ✅ Hover shows "Learn More" button
- ✅ Click opens detailed modal with full information
- ✅ Modal shows: description, values, dark sides, combinations, examples
- ✅ User can select archetype from modal or close to browse more
- ✅ Selected archetype is highlighted in grid
- ✅ User clicks "Continue" to advance

**Test 3: Comprehensive Mode - Archetype Combination**
- ✅ After selecting primary (e.g., Ruler), combination screen appears
- ✅ Shows recommended combinations for that archetype
- ✅ User selects secondary archetype (e.g., Sage)
- ✅ Combined archetype name displays ("The Judge")
- ✅ Combined description shows influence percentages
- ✅ Both primary and secondary icons display together
- ✅ Combination saves to state

**Test 4: Dark Sides Configuration**
- ✅ User selects "Configure Dark Sides"
- ✅ Shows "Too Much" dark side (e.g., "The Tyrant")
- ✅ Shows "Too Little" dark side (e.g., "The Abdicator")
- ✅ User can enable/disable each with checkboxes
- ✅ Descriptions explain what each dark side means
- ✅ Configuration saves to character state

**Test 5: Character Journey Mapping**
- ✅ User enters journey mapper
- ✅ Selects start archetype state (e.g., "Too Little Ruler - Abdicator")
- ✅ Enters transformation catalyst in text area
- ✅ Optionally adds key transformation moments
- ✅ Selects end archetype state (e.g., "Balanced Ruler")
- ✅ Visual journey diagram displays start → transformation → end
- ✅ Journey saves to character object

**Test 6: Deep Builder Questionnaire**

- ✅ Archetype detail modal is full-screen on mobile
- ✅ Touch interactions work smoothly
- ✅ Text remains readable at mobile sizes
- ✅ All buttons are easily tappable (44px+ touch targets)

### 10.2 Edge Cases

**No Story Context Available**:
- ✅ User somehow reaches archetype builder without completing prior steps
- ✅ AI suggestion uses generic prompts or shows message
- ✅ Encourages completing story type and audience first
- ✅ Grid browsing still works fully

**API Failure for AI Suggestion**:
- ✅ AI service times out or fails
- ✅ Error message: "Couldn't generate suggestion. Browse archetypes below."
- ✅ Grid browsing remains fully functional
- ✅ Retry button available for AI suggestion

**Invalid Archetype Combination**:
- ✅ User somehow selects same archetype as primary and secondary
- ✅ Validation prevents this: "Choose a different secondary archetype"
- ✅ Or automatically suggests valid combinations only

**Journey Mapping Without Transformation**:
- ✅ User sets start and end to same archetype and state
- ✅ Gentle warning: "This shows no transformation. Consider..."
- ✅ Still allows saving (user may want static character)

**Extremely Long Journey Notes**:
- ✅ User writes 1000+ character transformation description
- ✅ Character counter shows current length
- ✅ Optional: "Consider condensing to key moments" suggestion
- ✅ Stores full text without truncation

**Mode Switch Mid-Process**:
- ✅ User starts in Comprehensive, builds complex archetype with combination
- ✅ User switches to Quick Mode
- ✅ System preserves primary archetype, removes secondary/journey
- ✅ Confirmation dialog warns about data loss
- ✅ User can cancel switch or proceed

## 11. Open Questions & Risks

### 11.1 Open Questions

1. **Should we allow custom archetypes?**
   - Pro: Ultimate flexibility for advanced users
   - Con: Loses framework benefits, hard to guide
   - **Recommendation**: No for MVP, consider for Phase 2

2. **Should archetype combinations be limited or unlimited?**
   - Option A: Only show validated combinations (100+ curated)
   - Option B: Allow any 2 archetypes to combine
   - **Recommendation**: Start with validated, expand based on demand

3. **How to handle archetype conflicts with story type?**
   - If user selects archetype that seems wrong for their story?
   - **Recommendation**: Show gentle suggestion but allow override

4. **Should we gamify archetype discovery?**
   - Achievement badges for exploring all archetypes?
   - "Rare combination" indicators?
   - **Recommendation**: Test in Phase 2 after core functionality solid

5. **Multi-character stories?**
   - Some stories need hero + antagonist archetypes
   - **Recommendation**: MVP = single character, Phase 2 = multiple

### 11.2 Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Users overwhelmed by 12 options | High | Medium | AI suggestions, deep builder, clear categorization |
| Archetype feels too restrictive | Medium | Low | Emphasize "starting point" not rigid box, allow customization |
| Combinations create confusion | Medium | Medium | Only show recommended combinations, clear explanations |
| Users don't understand archetypes | High | High | Rich educational content, examples, "This is you when..." |
| AI suggestions are poor quality | High | Low | Multiple alternatives, ability to ignore, human-curated fallbacks |
| Dark sides feel negative | Medium | Medium | Frame as growth opportunities, optional feature |
| Journey mapping too complex | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive Mode only, optional, visual aids |
| Cultural archetype misalignment | Low | Low | Jungian archetypes are cross-cultural, but validate with diverse users |

### 11.3 Technical Risks

**State Management Complexity**:
- Risk: Archetype + combination + journey + dark sides = complex state
- Mitigation: Well-structured data object, TypeScript for type safety, thorough testing

**Modal Performance**:
- Risk: Large archetype detail modals with lots of content lag
- Mitigation: Lazy load modal content, optimize images, virtualization if needed

**AI Cost**:
- Risk: Every user gets AI suggestion = potentially high API costs
- Mitigation: Cache common suggestions, limit to once per story, smart prompting

12.3 State Management Pattern
javascript// In StoryContext
const [storyData, setStoryData] = useState({
  // ... other story data
  character: {
    primary: null,
    secondary: null,
    combined: null,
    journey: null,
    selectionMethod: null,
    selectedAt: null,
    isSimplified: false
  }
});

// Helper functions
const selectPrimaryArchetype = (archetypeId) => {
  const archetype = archetypesLibrary[archetypeId];
  setStoryData(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    character: {
      ...prev.character,
      primary: {
        id: archetype.id,
        name: archetype.name,
        icon: archetype.icon,
        tagline: archetype.tagline,
        values: archetype.values,
        gift: archetype.gift,
        darkSides: {
          tooMuch: { ...archetype.darkSides.tooMuch, enabled: false },
          tooLittle: { ...archetype.darkSides.tooLittle, enabled: false }
        }
      },
      selectedAt: new Date().toISOString()
    }
  }));
};

const addSecondaryArchetype = (archetypeId) => {
  const primary = storyData.character.primary.id;
  const combination = archetypeCombinations[primary][archetypeId];
  
  setStoryData(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    character: {
      ...prev.character,
      secondary: {
        id: archetypeId,
        name: archetypesLibrary[archetypeId].name,
        icon: archetypesLibrary[archetypeId].icon
      },
      combined: {
        name: combination.name,
        description: combination.description,
        primaryInfluence: 60,
        secondaryInfluence: 40
      }
    }
  }));
};

const configureDarkSides = (tooMuch, tooLittle) => {
  setStoryData(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    character: {
      ...prev.character,
      primary: {
        ...prev.character.primary,
        darkSides: {
          tooMuch: { ...prev.character.primary.darkSides.tooMuch, enabled: tooMuch },
          tooLittle: { ...prev.character.primary.darkSides.tooLittle, enabled: tooLittle }
        }
      }
    }
  }));
};

const saveCharacterJourney = (journeyData) => {
  setStoryData(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    character: {
      ...prev.character,
      journey: journeyData
    }
  }));
};
